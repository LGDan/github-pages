You know when someone keeps asking you to do something... and the thing is quite sensible... but the *mere fact* that they're chasing you to do the thing makes you not want to do it... so you put it off for a few days... and think "oh pants I really need to get that done now"... and before you know it, it's 22:28 and you think "Good gravy, is that the time?"

I should just commit'n'merge it to main and call it an evening. Oh, and update the link in the CV.

... and if you're reading this within the few days of me posting this... good news! This is for you! Aren't you lucky! The fact this URL used to 404 made me do something about it. Can't be having dead links.
